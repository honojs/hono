Hono - _**\[ç‚Ž\] means flameðŸ”¥ in Japanese**_ - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges.
It works on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute@Edge, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Lagon, Node.js, and others.
Fast, but not only fast.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hono!'))

export default app
```

## Quick Start

```
npm create hono@latest my-app
```

## Features

- **Ultrafast** - The routers are really fast and smart. Not using linear loops. Fast.
- **Multi-runtime** - Works on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute@Edge, Deno, Bun, Lagon, or Node.js. The same code runs on all platforms.
- **Batteries Included** - Hono has built-in middleware, custom middleware, and third-party middleware. Batteries included.
- **Delightful DX** - First-class TypeScript support. Now, we've got "Types".
- **Small** - About 20kB. Zero-dependencies. Using only Web Standard API.
